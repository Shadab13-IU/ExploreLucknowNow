                    <h1> Bara Imambara</h1>
                    <p>One of the most well-known buildings in the city is the Lucknow Bara Imambara. It is one of the most beautiful examples of Mughal architecture and a rightful triumph and ode to engineering.
                        Winding and a bizarre labyrinth of narrow passageways running through the upper floor of the monument are the true showstoppers. It is also known as the Bhool Bhulaiya passage.
                        #Trivia: This Bara Imambara is second in size only to the Nizamat Imambara</p>

                        Chhota Imambara Lucknow is a beautiful and well-preserved example of Mughal architecture. Apart from the graves of the nawab and his mother, the complex has two other tombs of the royal family members. You can learn about its fascinating history with a guided tour</p>

                        </h1>
                    <p>The Rumi Darwaza (Gate) is an incredible structure which stands imposingly between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Constructed in 1784 under the rule of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it is a fine example of Awadhi architecture, or the Lucknow School of Architecture. It was a style adopted by the Nawabs of Awadh to preserve the Mughal architectural style while experimenting with newer styles and materials.</p>
